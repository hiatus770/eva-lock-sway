## Installation

To install run 
`make install` 

This will tell you if you are missing any deps that are needed, you need wayland, freetype, gcc, libxkbcommon, libegl, and that should be it 

## Usage
Run 
`evaclock` after installing 

## Issues 

If there are any issues you can make an issue and I will try my best to address it. Make sure to give system information like the window manager and os you are using as well as the logs from running the command
